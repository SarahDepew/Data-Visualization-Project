	I got this dataset from a website online when I did a Google search for data sets. (Website links: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html and https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/lme4/sleepstudy.html). I went with the original formatting of the provided file and simply adjusted my parsing accordingly. The data did not really need to be cleaned. I simply disregarded the first data column when I organized the data in to a string of the type Subject.
